        The Covid-19 Pandemic affected us all. After a closure of 11 weeks we
        have re-opened the studio already on the 1st of June. We follow the
        guidelines of the National Institute for Public Health and the
        Environment, which is part of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport
        (www.rivm.nl/en). RIVM monitors the situation together with
        international partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO)
        and the European Center for Disease Protection and Control (ECDC).
        Classes and the Summer Intensive 2020 will go on, unless there is a rise
        in COVID19 cases and the Dutch government decides to restrict
        activities, such as this one. Should this happen. we will refund your
        full fee minus 15 euros administration costs. Any travel and housing
        expenses are at your own cost.

        measurements. Do read them carefully before you come to the studio! It
        is updated regularly.

        attend because of quarantine issues. Dancers from all other countries
        can not apply at this moment. As always, only dancers of
        advanced/professional level will be admitted and admission will be based
        on the CV and dance film you must send with your application.

        People who registered already, do check your schedule and see if there
        are changes which causes conflicts. If so, do register again, and write
        in an email to: intensives@hjs.amsterdam what should be adapted /
        refunded. You get priority if the workshop takes place on another date.
        Classes: Regular technique classes are open to dancers of
        advanced/professional level and no pre-registration is necessary. 5 or
        10 class cards and Heavy Users Passes (30 days unlimited) can be paid
        for online at the registration desk in the studio. Single classes must
        be paid for at the registration desk. Workshops: It is necessary to
        pre-register on the site and then send a CV and dance film. A selection
        is made on the basis of the CVs (usually we choose a mix of
        professionals and students) and then payment must be made. Workshops are
        mostly 5 days workshops (Monday to Friday) and weekend workshops. If you
        register for more than one workshop you only need to send the cv and
        dance film once.
